There has been a fair amount of media coverage concerning the downside of crunch in recent years, and deservedly so, but crunch is different in a smaller company like this. In very large companies, crunch can be ruinous to peoples' lives, consisting of compulsory overnight working sessions that sometimes last for weeks. At Hello Games, it felt different."

This is a studio whose size means that everyone had a significant personal investment and involvement in the game; that sense of ownership creates a positive atmosphere and changes the long, hardworking nights into something that feels worthwhile and satisfying. Your boss is a lot more visible, too, so instead of having this unreasonable directive from an invisible higher power, you can nip over to the adjacent desk and say 'Sean, I'm going to go home'."
