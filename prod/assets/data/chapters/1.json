This was his ice breaker following a tense team meeting where he expressed concerns over the weaker areas of the current build, and how little time was left."

              "value": "This was a meeting to make sure everyone was on track and give them a bit of a scare in case anyone was getting too comfortable. It made me realise that this must happen for every game, even seemingly frivolous ones about overtly happy stuntmen with massive chins. The message was 'here's the deadline, it's very real and we still have a lot of stuff to get through'. There needed to exist a good, solid build of the game before the rapidly approaching GamesCom: the biggest annual gaming convention in Europe, held in Cologne, Germany. That deadline was now very real, and all the fear and trepidation that came with it left a palpable sense of urgency in the air. The obstacles in the way of finishing the game were significantly less bright, colourful and fun than the ones comprising the game's courses."

              "value": "This visit had been quite a contrast to my previous visits to the studio. Normally, when I step through the front door, Hello Games is a light-hearted, relaxed and fun place to be. That's not to say there isn't hard work that goes on: it's a laid back environment with people working hard on something they love. This meeting punctured that atmosphere for a brief second. I felt incredibly privileged to be in the room at what I felt was a very personal moment for everyone in the team."

I wasn't interested in gruelling technical details, like the ones you get in those utterly dull dev diaries from big name publishers; I didn't want to know what it was like to be a dev, I wanted to know what it felt like to be a person working on a game.

I have stayed up with them til 4am on crunch days, bleary-eyed, I have sat with them, boozed up in the streets of Cologne on a hot summer night and I was present at the birth of the now legendary sport known as HATBALL. I can only thank them for letting me into their lives so openly and allowing me to tell this story; it was an absolute dream to be a part of."

What I didn't realise is that I would experience some of those stresses myself: this final documentary reaches you in something approaching its fourth form. As I worked from the raw materials of images taken and piles of notes made, I met various unforeseen obstacles along the way. Over two years have passed since the final  photo was taken at the end of this book and, since then, Hello Games have been through many changes."

What we now have is a finely matured story detailing Hello Games' history and their road to success; a look into their working lives and relationships prior to the huge explosion of popularity following the announcement of No Man's Sky."
